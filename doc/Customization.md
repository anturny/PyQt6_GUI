# QPushButton

We will always need a file for widgets in the [wind.py](/src/Customization/wind.py) file.

We will copy the contents of the [windowCreation4.py](/src/WindowCreation/windowCreation4.py) into the wind.py file and delete the stylesheet and window opacity lines. We will then copy the contents into the [btnexample.py](/src/Customization/btnexample.py) file.

In this file, we learn about importing QMenu and QPushButton from QtWidget, QSize from QtCore, and QFont from QtGui.

QMenu: Class used to create menu widgets
QPushButton: Clickable widget to trigger actions in UI
QSize: Class that changes size of window
QFont: Class that changes font type and size

We customize the push button and drop down menu by manipulating its size, color, and font.
